# Women Director Representation in Motion Picture Awards

The following project's aim is to visually demonstrate the representation of women directors in motion picture awards in the last twenty years (2000-2020)


## The Database 

We chose to work with three of the best known motion picutre awards, namely the Oscars (USA), BAFTAs (UK) and Césars (FR) to also integrate a cross-cultural component. 

We pulled our data from the following websites and compiled them into a JSON file. 

### Oscars :

### BAFTAs :

### Césars :

## The visualiuation 

We decided to go with a matrix representation as we felt it would have the strongest visual impact. The same argument made us chose size variation to represent the number of nominees and colour variation to represent years with winners. 

We chose to give the viewer the option to see either one award timeline at a time, or two, or even all three together so that they can have a complete or selective experience of the data according to their needs. 

As it was important for us to give visibility to the women directors individually, when clicking on the dots in the matrix, it is possible to see the names of the nominees and the winners when applicable. 

To achieve the desired results we used HTML for the front end and JavaScript for the backend. We decided to work on two separate files as the final result comes in a home page and the visualisation page. 

## The results 

It is very interesting to note the following points (amongst others) : 

1. Women representation in motion picture awards is lacking and fluctuating. 

2. Where Anglo-Saxon awards are concerned (Oscars, BAFTAs) there is a relatively significant overlap in nominees and winners 

3. The Césars have the largest representation in women nominees but the smallest in women winners
